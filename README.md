# Express Stream MP3 File Example

This was code written as part of a bigger project related to using cloud text-to-speech services.
I wanted to record the basic example of streaming an audio file with express, and autoplaying it using an <audio> element.

## Running

    npm i

    npm start

With browser, visit http://localhost:3000

Click the button labeled "Request audio stream".

You should hear an MP3 auto-play regarding taking out the garbage after work.

If you don't hear this, inspect your browsers audio auto-play settings, as this is often disabled by default, as it is considered bad practice.
